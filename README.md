# libft

This started as my first project of 42 school.<br>
The goal was to recreate some of the often used functions in C with very limited resources (mostly write and malloc) and create a library of them, that can be reused in future projects.<br><br>
This by now is a very refined version of that library, which will not pass moulinette anymore, but is way more functional.<br>
